    NOMY FOX-DICHTER is an NYC-based videographer.  She believes in the power of visual storytelling to explore seemingly divergent facets of everyday life.  Her creative work primarily focuses on female relationships, scientific thinking, and the art of people-watching.  



Experienced in documentary-style filmmaking, Nomy worked as a professional videographer for five years across two summer camps.  At Becket-Chimney Corners YMCA, she earned the Dorothy Irons Unsung Hero award, given to a staff member who demonstrates outstanding work ethic.  



As an undergraduate, she assisted on numerous Columbia University School of the Arts MFA theses and was a Barnard Media Center Emerging Filmmaker.  As a filmmaking fellow, her upcoming short film Birdies will premiere at the Athena Film Festival in 2021 in New York City.   



Nomy was born and raised in New York City.  She is a graduate of Barnard College of Columbia University in Morningside Heights, where she earned a BA in Film Studies and Physics.  She is an alumna of Prague Film School in the Czech Republic and completed a program at Maine Media Workshops + College in Rockport, Maine. 



She believes that kindness, openness, and respect are necessary for innovative yet authentic work.
